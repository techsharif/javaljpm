    int tied = 0;
```

- ArrayList<Player> members = new ArrayList<>()
- boolean addPlayer(T player)
    - false â†’ System.out.println(player.getName() + " is already on this team");
    - true â†’ System.out.println(player.getName() + " picked for team " + [this.name](http://this.name/));
- public int numPlayers()
- public void matchResult(Team opponent, int ourScore, int theirScore)
    - this.getName() + message + opponent.getName()
    - message = " beat "; message = " drew with "; message = " lost to ";
- public int ranking()
    - win 2 point
    - tie 1 point

League class

- private ArrayList<Team> league = new ArrayList<>();
- public boolean add(Team team)
    - true â†’ if add
    - false â†’ if already exists
- public void showLeagueTable()
    - System.out.println(t.getName() + ": " + t.ranking()); â†’ sorted item desc

Main class

```java
public class Main {

	    // ArrayList<Team> teams;
        // Collections.sort(teams);
        // Create a generic class to implement a league table for a sport.
        // The class should allow teams to be added to the list, and store
        // a list of teams that belong to the league.
        //
        // Your class should have a method to print out the teams in order,
        // with the team at the top of the league printed first.
        //
        // Only teams of the same type should be added to any particular
        // instance of the league class - the program should fail to compile
        // if an attempt is made to add an incompatible team.
